# The vision
This project will be concerned with developing a tool for live programming of Cobots, 
with the option for reversing commands. This enables the functionality of undo/redo while live-programming a physical cobots.
The aim is to create a REPL that can work as a Console for exploring the features of the proprietary programming language of the Cobot.
